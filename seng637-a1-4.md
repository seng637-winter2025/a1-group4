# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

Before this lab, we had some brief experience with testing, using edge cases and boundary conditions. 

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Test Plan Overview
Key Details:
Target Functions:
ATM card validation and PIN entry
Cash withdrawal
Deposit
Fund transfer between accounts
Balance inquiry
Transaction cancellation
Error handling (invalid PIN, transaction failure)
Receipt generation
Log management
Key-operated switch behavior (operator start/stop)
Test Approach:
Balanced Testing Approach: Given the number of functions, We’ll target testing a few functions in depth while also testing some critical paths that touch multiple components (e.g., successful and unsuccessful transactions, logging, and communication with the bank).
Test both common paths (e.g., withdrawal of cash, balance inquiry) and exceptional paths (e.g., invalid PIN, canceling a transaction, system error scenarios).
We’ll focus on testing the interactions with the bank system and ensure the communication, approvals, and error messages work as expected.
We’ll also test edge cases where the ATM might behave unexpectedly, such as multiple rapid requests, incorrect card insertion, or transaction failure scenarios.
Sessions will be iterative: Testing for different valid and invalid scenarios will be done sequentially while recording any defects or discrepancies.
Test Case Generation:
Start by using happy path scenarios:
Card Insertion & PIN Validation: Test valid card and PIN, invalid PIN up to the third attempt, and permanent retention of the card.
Cash Withdrawal: Ensure the system accepts multiple withdrawal requests and handles insufficient funds.
Deposit: Test deposits.
Balance Inquiry: Test multiple accounts linked to the same card.
Then test error handling scenarios:
Cancel Transaction: Press the cancel button in the middle of various transactions.
Transaction Rejection: Test scenarios where the bank rejects a transaction due to insufficient funds or other issues.
Invalid Card: Test system behavior with an invalid card or a card with expired data.
Machine Shutdown: Verify system response to operator shutdown during active customer interaction.
Envelope Timeout: Test the timeout period for deposits when an envelope is not inserted.
Explore boundary conditions ( withdrawal of the maximum allowed amount, maximum number of attempts for PIN, minimum and maximum cash deposit).
Testing Scope
Card and PIN Interaction:
Verify that the ATM handles valid and invalid cards/PINs.
Validate that after three incorrect PIN attempts, the card is permanently retained.
Transactions:
Cash Withdrawal: Ensure the ATM dispenses cash in multiples of $20. Test successful transactions, failed transactions (e.g., insufficient funds), and cancelation during withdrawal.
Deposit: Verify envelope deposit (cash/check) handling. Check for timeout scenarios, successful deposits, and error handling.
Fund Transfer: Ensure fund transfer between two accounts is processed and logged correctly.
Balance Inquiry: Confirm correct balance information is displayed for different accounts.
Cancel Transaction:
Verify that pressing the Cancel key stops the current transaction and returns to the main screen, without executing any action.
Receipt Generation:
Verify that after each successful transaction (withdrawal, deposit, transfer, balance inquiry), a receipt is printed with the correct details (e.g., date, location, amount, account balances).
Error Handling:
Verify that when a transaction fails, the ATM displays the correct error message and prompts the user for further action (e.g., do they want to try again or cancel).
Test how the ATM reacts to system failures or interruptions (e.g., network issues with the bank system).
Operator Controls:
Verify the behavior when the ATM is started/stopped using the key-operated switch. Test the operator’s ability to enter cash on hand and manage system shutdown during customer service.
Transaction Logs:
Verify that each transaction is logged correctly. Check that sensitive information is not logged, and that the system accurately logs both successful and failed transactions.
Expected Outcome
The ATM should behave as described in the requirements, with:
Proper handling of user inputs (PIN, transaction amounts, etc.).
Accurate transactions (withdrawals, deposits, transfers).
Correct error messages when transactions fail.
Timely transaction log updates.
Reliable operator interaction through the key switch and log management.

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

For the pair testing we split into teams of two, to tackle the problem, and combined our work in the end. The teams were Pahul and Matheus and Samin and Saba.  In terms of work, we divided the 40 test cases amongst ourselves, and worked on 10 each, ensuring we could do a quaility job.
